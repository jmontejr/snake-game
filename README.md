Being inspired by the project [Recreating the snake game with JavaScript](https://web.digitalinnovation.one/lab/recriando-o-jogo-da-cobrinha-com-javascript/learning/a41588bb-45b0-41ce-a7d3-20012199fb11) from Bootcamp [HTML Web Developer](https://web.digitalinnovation.one/track/html-web-developer) of the platform [Digital Innovation One](https://digitalinnovation.one/), this project aims to practice CSS Flexbox.

A refactoring was carried out in the project's javascript, where some concepts were applied to make it more current.
